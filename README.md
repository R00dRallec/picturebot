# Picturebot

This project was founded out of boredom.

A telegram bot, which is sending a picture from a subreddit to a telegram group.

Based on its configuration, it can randomly select a subreddit from a given list.

It has a history of up to ten sent posts per subreddit, to prevent resending the same picture.
